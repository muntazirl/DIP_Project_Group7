# Week 1 Report (4/10/25)


### **Objective**
Our goal was to research and understand the concept of Image Inpainting.

---

### **Work Done**
Understood Image inpainting : Image painting means basically, the process of removing noise or unwanted objects or strokes, or marks from the images and filling the area with the color of the surrounding pixels to make it uniform.  

- Went through different inpainting algorithms used by libraries such as OpenCV.
- We are also looking to use Nearest Neighbour method, as taught in class by the professor, to find the similar patch from surrounding to replace the object/stroke.
- One was the **Fast Marching Method algorithm by Telea** and the other one was using **Navier Stokes**, based on **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**.

### **Plan for Next Week**
We shall start with coding basic stuff like deciding libraries to use and how to handle and make masks according to images. We shall finalise an algorithm to use in the project.
